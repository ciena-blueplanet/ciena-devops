# FEATURE REQUEST / CODE CHANGE

* [ ] I have deleted the **BUG REPORT** section

## Summary
* [ ] Provide a general summary of the requested feature in the title above
* [ ] Provide a one-paragraph explanation of the requested feature:


## Motivation
* Describe the big picture of your feature to communicate why it should be added.
  * Why are we doing this?
  * What use cases does it support?
  * What is the expected outcome?

## Detailed design
This is the bulk of the Feature Request / Code Change.

Explain the design in enough detail for somebody familiar with this addon, the UI Platform ecosystem, and Ember.js to understand, and for somebody familiar with the implementation to implement. This should get into specifics and corner-cases, and include examples of how the feature is used. Any new terminology should be defined here.

## How we teach this

* What names and terminology work best for these concepts and why?
* How should this feature be introduced and taught to existing users?

## Drawbacks

* Why should we ***not*** do this? Please consider the impact...
  * ...on teaching this
  * ...on the integration of this feature with other existing and planned features
  * ...on the impact of the API churn on existing apps
  * ...etc.
* There are tradeoffs to choosing any path, please attempt to identify them here.

## Alternatives

* What other designs have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?
* This section could also include prior art, that is, how other addons or libraries in the same domain have solved this problem.

## Unresolved questions

* Optional, but suggested for first drafts. What parts of the design are still TBD?
